# UIOFive (formally FSSFive) 

## About

UIOFive, as of right now, is only different than FSSFive in name only. It's still a clean, simple and accessible WordPress blogging theme, employing components of [The Fluid Project](http://fluidproject.org/) Infusion framework, the Fluid Skinning System (FSS) and User Interface Options (UIOptions).

Why the name change? Well, as of the release of Infusion 1.5, Fluid Skinning System (FSS) has been depreciated. "[There are no CSS Framework requirements for working with Infusion. Infusion's strategy going forward will be to use custom CSS for component specific styling and Foundation for demos, as needed](http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/DeprecationsIn1_5.html)."

This is, or it is my hope that one day it very much will be, a solid a starting point. Granted much of what UIOFive uses to function as an accessible platform, mainly FSS and UIOptions, are still being developed. This will become ever more stable as time goes on. Both the work of the Fluid Project, as well as my own, specifically. Not by any stretch of your imagination is it finished, like most of everything on the web, itâ€™s a work in progress.

UIOFive employs a lot of the standard WordPress elements, IDs and classes.
